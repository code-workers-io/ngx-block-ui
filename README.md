> **Important Note**
> This library has its origin in the awesome [ng-block-ui](https://github.com/kuuurt13/ng-block-ui) library
> from kuuurt13. We are very thankful for his work.
> Why did we release it as a new library? Mainly to support Ivy, a modern Angular environment and of course
> to ship new features and improvements.
